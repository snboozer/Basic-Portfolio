            Hello! I'm Shamera Boozer and welcome to my portfolio site. I have a background in Art and Psychology.
            I originially chose those to areas to combine two things that I am passionate about: showcasing my creativity 
            and helping people. The switch over to the Coding field was an easy decision for me. I will still be able to
            display my creativity, while helping people solve problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been working in the Coding field for the past 3 months and can
            say whole heartedly that this has been the most challenging time I have had in all my years of education. I stumble a
            lot
            with coding, but I can see myself getting better and grasping the concepts more each week. Please take a look around on my site and visit my pojects that I have completed so far.
            I will be continuosly updating this page throughout the course with new and challenging material. I can't wait to
            see my skills I have mastered by the end of the program in October!
